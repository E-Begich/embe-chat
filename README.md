### Here is my project in ReactJs for the Front End final exam on Algebra.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

When the project is open, you will get an initial form where you need to write the username that you want to use.

Once when you write the username and push enter or click on the Sign in button you will get a main chat where you can talk with other people.
