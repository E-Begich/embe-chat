### Here is my project in ReactJs for the Front End final exam on Algebra.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

When the project is open, you will get an initial form where you need to write the username that you want to use.
